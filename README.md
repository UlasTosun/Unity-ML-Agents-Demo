# Unity-ML-Agents-Demo


A template and demo project for Unity ML-Agents Toolkit. Project has an environment to train agent to hit a target. The environment also includes a wall and a non-target object. The agent should not hit the non-target object. You can simply assume that, the target object is the bad guy and the non-target object is a hostage. The positions of target, non-target and wall changes at the beginning of every episode. You can see the environment below.


**[You can find complete Unity project folder in here.](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1i45Nl_Ew3kjEa1NUfoKRF3wzHv-Z00bp?usp=sharing)** Since, GitHub has file count and size limitations, I have uploaded the project to Google Drive.

Project has been developed on Unity 2021.2.0f1 by using ML Agents Package 2.0.0. If you are facing with errors, **please check your Unity and package versions**. Please keep in my that using different versions may result with errors.
